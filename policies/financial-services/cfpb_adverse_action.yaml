description: >
  Validates that AI-driven credit decision models produce specific, individualized
  adverse action reasons as required by CFPB Circular 2023-03. Models cannot rely on
  generic denial buckets — each adverse action must map to specific factors in the
  applicant's actual financial behavior. This is especially critical for models using
  alternative data or complex algorithms.

applies_to:
  - credit scoring models
  - loan approval models
  - credit limit models
  - automated underwriting systems
  - any model producing credit denial decisions

bias_types_addressed:
  - explainability-deficit
  - generic-denial-reasons
  - black-box-decisions

policy_logic:
  # Reason code specificity: model must produce specific reasons, not generic buckets
  # Score 0-1 where 1 = fully specific, 0 = entirely generic
  reason_code_specificity_min_threshold: 0.70
  
  # Model must be able to produce at least 4 specific reasons per denial
  min_reason_codes_per_denial_min_threshold: 4
  
  # Reason codes must map to actual model features (not post-hoc rationalizations)
  reason_feature_alignment_min_threshold: 0.80
  
  # Explainability score (SHAP/LIME coverage)
  explainability_coverage_min_threshold: 0.65

checks:
  - name: "Reason Code Specificity"

    metric: "reason_code_specificity_score"

    threshold_value: 4
    failure_severity: "HIGH"

  - name: "Reason-Feature Alignment"
    description: "Stated denial reasons must correspond to actual model features used in the decision"
    metric: "reason_feature_alignment_score"
    threshold_type: "min"
    threshold_value: 0.80
    failure_severity: "CRITICAL"

  - name: "Model Explainability Coverage"
    description: "SHAP or LIME explanations must cover ≥ 65% of model decision variance"
    metric: "explainability_coverage_score"
    threshold_type: "min"
    threshold_value: 0.65
    failure_severity: "HIGH"

remediation_steps:
  - "Step 1: Audit current reason codes — replace generic buckets (e.g., 'credit history') with specific factors (e.g., '3 late payments over 60 days in past 12 months')"
  - "Step 2: Implement SHAP or LIME to generate per-applicant feature importance scores"
  - "Step 3: Map top contributing features to human-readable adverse action reason codes"
  - "Step 4: Validate that each denial produces at least 4 specific, accurate reasons"
  - "Step 5: Test adverse action notices against CFPB sample scenarios for specificity"
  - "Step 6: Document the reason code generation methodology for regulatory examination"

limitations:
  - "Specificity scoring is based on heuristic analysis of reason code text granularity"
  - "Explainability coverage depends on SHAP/LIME implementation quality"
  - "This policy checks model capability to produce reasons — not the delivery mechanism to consumers"
  - "Consult qualified legal counsel for adverse action notice compliance"
