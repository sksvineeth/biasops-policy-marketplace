description: >
  Validates that mortgage and credit model datasets meet Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
  (HMDA) reporting requirements. Checks data completeness for required fields, validates
  denial rate disparities across demographic groups, and screens for geographic lending
  patterns that may indicate redlining.

applies_to:
  - mortgage lending models
  - home equity lending models
  - credit scoring models for housing-related credit

protected_classes:
  - race
  - ethnicity
  - sex
  - income_level

bias_types_addressed:
  - data-completeness
  - denial-rate-disparity
  - geographic-redlining

regulation_references:
  - article: "Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. § 2801)"

policy_logic:
  # Data completeness: required HMDA fields must be present
  hmda_field_completeness_min_threshold: 0.95
  
  # Denial rate disparity across race/ethnicity
  denial_rate_disparity_max_threshold: 2.0
  
  # Geographic concentration index (Herfindahl-style)
  # High concentration in non-minority areas may indicate redlining
  geographic_lending_equity_min_threshold: 0.60

checks:
  - name: "HMDA Field Completeness"
    description: "Required HMDA fields (action_taken, loan_purpose, property_type, race, sex, income) must be ≥ 95% complete"
    metric: "hmda_field_completeness"
    threshold_type: "min"
    threshold_value: 0.95
    failure_severity: "CRITICAL"
    required_fields:
      - action_taken
      - loan_purpose
      - loan_amount
      - property_type
      - race
      - ethnicity
      - sex
      - income
      - denial_reason

  - name: "Denial Rate Disparity Ratio"
    description: "Ratio of highest to lowest group denial rate must not exceed 2.0x"
    metric: "denial_rate_disparity_ratio"
    threshold_type: "max"
    threshold_value: 2.0
    failure_severity: "HIGH"

  - name: "Geographic Lending Distribution"
    description: "Lending must not be concentrated exclusively in non-minority census tracts"
    metric: "geographic_lending_equity_index"
    threshold_type: "min"
    threshold_value: 0.60
    failure_severity: "HIGH"

  - name: "Income Documentation Rate"
    description: "Income must be documented for ≥ 90% of applications to prevent steering"
    metric: "income_documentation_rate"
    threshold_type: "min"
    threshold_value: 0.90
    failure_severity: "MEDIUM"

remediation_steps:
  - "Step 1: Run HMDA data quality report to identify missing fields per column"
  - "Step 2: For completeness failures, trace missing data to origination system and fix collection"
  - "Step 3: For denial rate disparities, cross-reference with ECOA disparate impact analysis"
  - "Step 4: For geographic concentration, map lending activity by census tract demographics"
  - "Step 5: Document findings in annual HMDA submission package for regulator review"

limitations:
  - "Field completeness check validates presence, not accuracy of reported values"
  - "Geographic analysis requires census tract demographic data for full redlining assessment"
  - "Denial rate disparity is a screening metric — investigate root causes before concluding bias"
  - "Consult qualified legal counsel for HMDA compliance determinations"
