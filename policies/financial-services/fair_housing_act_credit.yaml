description: >
  Detects potential Fair Housing Act violations in AI-driven mortgage and housing-related
  credit decisions. Checks for prohibited proxy variable usage (e.g., ZIP code as race proxy),
  geographic redlining patterns, mortgage approval rate parity across demographics, and
  feature importance audits for correlations with protected class membership.

applies_to:
  - mortgage lending models
  - home equity lending models
  - property valuation models
  - automated underwriting systems for housing credit
  - tenant screening models

protected_classes:
  - race
  - color
  - national_origin
  - religion
  - sex
  - familial_status
  - disability

bias_types_addressed:
  - proxy-discrimination
  - geographic-redlining
  - approval-rate-disparity
  - feature-correlation-bias

policy_logic:
  # Proxy variable detection: correlation between features and protected classes
  # Correlation > 0.50 indicates potential proxy
  proxy_correlation_max_threshold: 0.50
  
  # Mortgage approval rate parity (similar to 4/5ths rule)
  approval_rate_parity_min_threshold: 0.80
  
  # Geographic lending equity (lending across minority/non-minority tracts)
  geographic_equity_index_min_threshold: 0.65
  
  # Feature importance audit: no single protected-correlated feature > 15% importance
  protected_feature_importance_max_threshold: 0.15

    metric: "min_approval_rate_ratio"
    threshold_type: "min"
    threshold_value: 0.80
    failure_severity: "CRITICAL"

    description: "Lending activity must not be disproportionately concentrated in non-minority census tracts"
    metric: "geographic_equity_index"
    threshold_type: "min"
    threshold_value: 0.65
    failure_severity: "HIGH"

  - name: "Feature Importance Audit"
    description: "No feature correlated with protected classes should account for > 15% of model importance"
    metric: "max_protected_feature_importance"
    threshold_type: "max"
    threshold_value: 0.15
    failure_severity: "HIGH"

  - name: "Steering Pattern Detection"
    description: "Model recommendations must not systematically steer protected groups to less favorable products"
    metric: "steering_disparity_score"
    threshold_type: "max"
    threshold_value: 0.10
    failure_severity: "CRITICAL"

remediation_steps:
  - "Step 1: Run correlation analysis between all model features and protected class columns"
  - "Step 2: For features with correlation > 0.50, evaluate whether removal degrades model performance significantly"
  - "Step 3: If proxy feature is critical, implement bias mitigation (reweighting, adversarial debiasing)"
  - "Step 4: Map lending activity by census tract and compare to demographic composition"
  - "Step 5: Run SHAP feature importance and flag any protected-correlated feature > 15% importance"
  - "Step 6: Document all findings and remediation actions for fair lending examination file"

limitations:
  - "Proxy detection uses statistical correlation which may flag benign features — human review required"
  - "Geographic analysis requires census tract demographic data not included in model data"
  - "Feature importance thresholds are screening levels, not legal bright lines"
  - "Steering detection requires product-level data (rates, terms) beyond basic approval/denial"
  - "Consult qualified legal counsel for Fair Housing Act compliance determinations"
