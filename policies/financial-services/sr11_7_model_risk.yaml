description: >
  Evaluates AI/ML model governance practices against OCC/Federal Reserve SR 11-7
  Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management. Checks for model documentation
  completeness, independent validation evidence, ongoing monitoring plans, and
  change management controls. Required for all models used in banking decisions.

applies_to:
  - all models used in banking decisions
  - credit risk models
  - market risk models
  - fraud detection models
  - AML/BSA models
  - any model subject to bank examination

bias_types_addressed:
  - governance-gap
  - documentation-deficit
  - validation-absence
  - monitoring-gap

checks:
  - name: "Model Documentation Completeness"
    description: "Model card must include: purpose, methodology, assumptions, limitations, performance metrics, data sources"
    metric: "model_documentation_score"
    threshold_type: "min"
    threshold_value: 0.80
    failure_severity: "HIGH"
    required_sections:
      - model_purpose
      - methodology_description
      - key_assumptions
      - known_limitations
      - performance_metrics
      - training_data_sources
      - intended_use
      - out_of_scope_uses

  - name: "Independent Validation"
    description: "Model must have been validated by a party independent of the development team"
    metric: "independent_validation_performed"
    threshold_type: "must_be_true"
    threshold_value: true
    failure_severity: "HIGH"

  - name: "Ongoing Monitoring Plan"
    description: "Documented plan for ongoing model performance monitoring with defined triggers for review"
    metric: "monitoring_plan_documented"
    threshold_type: "must_be_true"
    threshold_value: true
    failure_severity: "MEDIUM"

  - name: "Change Management Controls"
    description: "Documented change management process including approval workflows and version control"
    metric: "change_management_documented"
    threshold_type: "must_be_true"
    threshold_value: true
    failure_severity: "MEDIUM"

  - name: "Model Inventory Registration"
    description: "Model must be registered in the enterprise model inventory with assigned risk tier"
    metric: "model_inventory_registered"
    threshold_type: "must_be_true"
    threshold_value: true
    failure_severity: "HIGH"

remediation_steps:
  - "Step 1: Complete model card with all required sections (purpose, methodology, assumptions, limitations, metrics, data sources)"
  - "Step 2: Schedule independent model validation with qualified internal or external team"
  - "Step 3: Create ongoing monitoring plan specifying metrics, frequency, and escalation triggers"
  - "Step 4: Document change management process with approval chain and version control requirements"
  - "Step 5: Register model in enterprise model inventory with appropriate risk tier classification"
  - "Step 6: Schedule periodic model review per SR 11-7 requirements (at least annually)"

limitations:
  - "Documentation completeness is assessed by field presence, not content quality"
  - "Independent validation check verifies documentation, not the quality of the validation itself"
  - "This policy supplements but does not replace bank examination procedures"
  - "Consult your institution's model risk management framework for specific requirements"
