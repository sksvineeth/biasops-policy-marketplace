description: >
  Evaluates AI-driven credit decisions for disparate impact across protected classes
  under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B. Uses the four-fifths
  (80%) rule as the primary screening threshold, consistent with EEOC Uniform Guidelines
  adopted by federal financial regulators for fair lending analysis.

applies_to:
  - credit scoring models
  - loan approval models
  - credit limit models
  - automated underwriting systems

protected_classes:
  - race
  - sex
  - age
  - national_origin

bias_types_addressed:
  - disparate-impact
  - selection-rate-disparity
  - demographic-proxy

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Policy Logic
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# The four-fifths rule: selection rate for any protected group must be
# at least 80% of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate.
# See 29 CFR § 1607.4(D).

policy_logic:
  # Core disparate impact check
  adverse_impact_ratio_min_threshold: 0.80
  
  # Statistical significance check (p-value from chi-squared test)
  # If p > 0.05, disparity is not statistically significant
  statistical_significance_max_threshold: 0.05
  
  # Demographic proxy detection
  # Model features must not serve as proxies for protected classes
  demographic_proxy_variables_must_be_false: true
  
  # Less Discriminatory Alternative documentation
  # Must document search for less discriminatory alternatives per Reg B
  lda_search_documented_must_be_true: true

remediation_steps:
  - "Step 1: Identify which protected classes fail the 4/5ths threshold by computing selection rates per group"
  - "Step 2: Analyze model features for proxy variables (e.g., ZIP code correlating with race)"
  - "Step 3: Document search for Less Discriminatory Alternatives (LDA) per Regulation B"
  - "Step 4: If LDA exists, implement it and re-run analysis"
  - "Step 5: If no LDA exists, document business necessity justification"
  - "Step 6: Submit updated analysis to compliance team for review before model deployment"

limitations:
  - "The 4/5ths rule is a screening tool, not a legal determination of discrimination"
  - "Small sample sizes may produce unreliable ratios — ensure n ≥ 30 per group"
  - "Statistical significance tests complement but do not replace the 4/5ths rule"
  - "This policy does not assess disparate treatment (intentional discrimination)"
  - "Consult qualified legal counsel for compliance determinations"
